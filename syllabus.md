# ACCY 571: Statistical Analyses for Accountancy #
# 
ACCY 571: Statistical Analyses for Accountancy explores advanced concepts in data science by employing a practical approach, including machine learning; probabilistic programming; text, network, and graph analysis; and cloud computing.

## Course Goals ##
## 
Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand advanced data science concepts. Students will learn the practical aspects of applying machine and statistical learning in a variety of contexts, as well as different aspects of cloud computing. Specific concepts that will be covered including supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensional reduction, clustering, probabilistic programming, text mining, graph analysis, network analysis, Hadoop, NoSQL data stores, Spark, and streaming data analysis.

## Prerequisites ##
## 
Technically, ACCY 570 is a pre-requisite for this course; however, we integrate the lecture for these two courses in such a way that any required concepts have been covered prior to the relevant material in ACCY 571.  In addition, we except students to have a strong interest in
learning the basic skills necessary for being a data scientist and
access to a computer to participate in the course lectures, and to
complete the required course assignments.

Note: At present, we are using NCSA's [Nebula][nb] Openstack cloud computing system to run a course JupyterHub server. Each student is running a Dockerized version of the course software stack. This provides many advantages including robustness against crashes, simplicity of deploying software updates, reduced requirements for students (simply a modern web browser, we have used tablets and smart phones), and simplifying assignment submission. You can also run a Docker container locally, as in previous courses, but this approach is not recommended. In addition, if you work locally, since assignments are automatically collected from your cloud-based Docker container, you must ensure that you push local changes to your course cloud Docker container prior to the deadline.

## Texts ##

There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will
utilize Internet accessible websites, videos, and documentation as
supplemental material to the lesson content. We also will include links,
as relevant, to readings from books that are freely available to
University of Illinois students, staff and faculty via the University's
Safari subscription.

## Academic Integrity ##

Academic honesty is essential to this course and the University. Any
instance of academic dishonesty (including but not limited to cheating,
plagiarism, falsification of data, and alteration of grades) will be
documented in the student's academic file. In addition, **at a minimum**
the particular assessment, exam, or assignment will be given a zero.
Serious or repeated offenses may be punished more severely.

**Guidelines for collaborative work**: Discussing course material with
your classmates is in general a good idea, but each student is expected
to do his or her own work. On assignments, you may discuss the problems
and concepts behind them, but you are responsible for your own answers.
Please do not post code in the forums! Finally, on assessments and
quizzes, your answers must of course be your own. For further info, see
the [Student Code, Part 4. Academic
Integrity](http://www.admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article_1/a1_1-401.html).

## Communication ##

The instructional staff will use the [Announcement Forum][af] on the
course Moodle to communicate important course information. Do not
unsubscribe from this forum or you risk missing important news!

The preferred method for student communication in this course is to use
the [Q&A Forum][qaf] on the course Moodle. The instructional staff monitors this forum and will respond in less than 24 hours (in general we will respond even faster than this, especially during normal business hours). Furthermore, your fellow students may be able to help even faster. We also encourage you to search this forum prior to making a new post since your question may have already been answered.  You can search a forum on Moodle by using the __Search forums__ tool that is located on the upper right corner of any Moodle forum.

If you have a question (that is not answered in this syllabus nor on the
online course forums) you can email the instructional staff, however,
this should be a last resort. If we feel the question is best answered
on the [Q&A Forum][qaf], we reserve the right to post your question and
our answer on Moodle.

## Course Outline ##

Note: The following list of topics is tentative. We build the course
during the semester for several reasons:

1. This is a new course, covering dynamic content!
2. This course integrates with ACCY 570, which is itself dynamic.

As a result, we feel it is imperative to be able to change the planned
pace and material to benefit the majority of enrolled students. We are currently planning on mixing the ACCY 570 and ACCY 571 lecture spots to guarantee proper topic coverage. As a result, the first four weeks of both courses will be used to cover ACCY 570 material, the next three and a half weeks will be used to cover ACCY 571 material, and the remaining weeks will utilize the regular class periods to cover material relevant to the appropriate course.

## Weekly Format ##
## 

Each week will provide learning objectives and an outline of the
activities for that week with a list of all deadlines and corresponding
point values for assignments.

### Readings ###

Readings will consist of articles and excerpts from books and Web sites,
internet-accessible videos demonstrating a concept, and, in some cases,
IPython Notebooks that can be viewed statically on the Github website,
or (via the preferred approach) by interacting with them via the course
JupyterHub server. You will be required to read and be familiar with the
content of these documents. Readings are contextualized as part of the
weekly lesson content and are located in the "Readings" section of each
lesson.

### Lessons ###

Lessons will expand upon, or clarify key concepts in the reading
assignments or supplement or add to the reading. Part of each class period will be used to review the concepts in the relevant readings, after which students will be expected to pursue these concepts in more depth. This will include using the course JupyterHub server to complete specific activities, such as learning to program, using the Unix command line, or working with a relational database.

### Lesson Assessments ###

Occasionally, a lecture period will also utilize a moodle assessment to spot-check understanding of important material. These assessments will form part of your class participation grade. These lesson assessments must all be completed in class.

### Assignments ###

Every week but the first and last will contain an assignment that will
involve one or more computational tasks related to the focus for that
given week. Your assignment will be automatically collected at the
deadline from the course JupyterHub server. These assignments will be
automatically graded for your instructor grade, and will also be
randomly distributed for peer assessment. You will have **up to five**
assignments to grade as part of peer assessment. You will receive thirty
points for simply grading your peer's assignments. Your peer assessment
score will be worth a maximum of forty points, and we will drop the
highest and lowest score and average the three remaining scores.

To receive full credit from instructor grading, your assignment must be
submitted prior to the deadline. There will be **NO** grace period, late
assignments will not be accepted. The assignment deadline is
6:00 PM Central on the Monday following the relevant week. 

**NOTE:** We will drop your two lowest assignment scores, but only if you performed peer assessment.

### Peer Review ###

Weekly assignments will be reviewed by your course peers, as well as
automatic instructor grading. 70 points (out of the maximum 150 points
for each assignment) for each weekly assignment submission
will derive from peer review, 80 points (out of the maximum 150 points
for each assignment) are assigned from automated instructor review. You will receive 30 points each week for simply viewing and grading your peers' assignments. Note that you can (and should) still grade your peers even if you miss an assignment submission. Peer review of an assignment must be completed by 6:00 PM Central on Saturday of the following week (i.e.,you submit your assignment on a Monday and you must peer assess other students assignments by the following Saturday). You will be assigned assignments to grade approximately one hour after the late assignment deadline, thus around 1:00 pm Tuesday afternoon of each week.

| **Item** | **Grade** | 
|----|----| 
| Instructor Assessment | 80 points |  
| Peer Grading | 30 points | 
|Peer Assessments | 40 points| 
| **Total** |  **150** points |

Note that we will *only* review clearly erroneous peer assessments (this
means there needs to be a major problem). Review requests that are
deemed insignificant are subject to an *instructor determined point
reduction*.

### Exams ###

This course will utilize two exams. The first exam will be in-class on Wednesday, October 12 from 11:00 am - 12:20 pm. The second exam will   likely be held during Finals week; more specific information will be forthcoming.

## Grading ##

### Grading Distribution ###

| Item | Grade Percentage | 
|-----------|-----|
| First Exam | 15% | 
| Second Exam | 15% | 
| Assignments | 60% |
| Lecture Participation | 10% | 

Note: We will drop your two lowest assignment scores, but only if you performed peer assessment.


### Grading Scale ###

Final grades will be graded on a curve, if necessary. The letter grade
cutoffs will be set at the traditional 90%, 80%, and 70% limits, and
plus/minus will be added if you are within two points of the traditional
cutoffs (so 100–98 is an A+ and 90–92 is an A-).

|Percentage|Letter Grade|
|--------|---------|
|98-100|A+|
|92-98|A|
|90-92|A-|
|88-90|B+|
|82-88|B|
|80-82|B-|
|78-80|C+|
|72-78|C|
|70-72|C-|
|68-70|D+|
|62-68|D|
|60-62|D-|
|Below 60|F|

### Extra Credit ###

There is a course Wiki hosted on the course github repository. If you
have a problem and obtain a solution (either through your own efforts or
in partnership with an instructor), consider writing your problem and
solution up as a FAQ post in the github wiki. You get extra credit for
doing this and also help your classmates!

To get credit for your wiki entry you must contact the course teaching assistant, Edward Kim. He will review your post and indicate how many points you will receive, and if he would be willing to review an edited post for additional information. You can submit multiple Wiki entries.
